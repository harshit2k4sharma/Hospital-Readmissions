# Ready to be discharged: predicting hospital readmissions

## Overview

This project addresses the challenge of hospital readmissions, focusing on diabetic patients, a significant issue that has a great impact on healthcare costs. <br>
The project resolved on developing two models: 
<li><b>Binary Classification</b>: Create a classification model that can accurately predict if a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of being discharged. </li>
<li><b>Multiclass Classification</b>: The second objective is to develop a multiclass classifier that predicts the timeframe of a patient’s readmission, with the classes being “No”, “<30 days”, “>30 days”.</li>
